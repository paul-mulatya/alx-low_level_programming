you said for that you would lose the reference to the head node in the above code. how comes the following code uses the h pointer directly? does it not lose the reference to its first node as well?         #include "lists.h"

size_t listint_len(const listint_t *h)
{
        size_t node = 0;

        while (h)
        {
                h = h->next;
                node++;
        }
        return (node);
}
